Product Review Analysis on Amazon for Lenovo using NLP and ML
Using NLP and machine learning, perform Topic Modeling on various reveiws on Amazon. I worked on this project for completion of Natural Language Processing module of my PGP course in Data Science from Simplilearn-Purdue University.

**DESCRIPTION:** Help a leading mobile brand understand the voice of the customer by analyzing the reviews of their product on Amazon and the topics that customers are talking about. Perform topic modeling on specific parts of speech and finally interpret the emerging topics.
A popular mobile phone brand, Lenovo has launched their budget smartphone in the Indian market. The client wants to understand the VOC (voice of the customer) on the product. This will be useful to not just evaluate the current product, but to also get some direction for developing the product pipeline. The client is particularly interested in the different aspects that customers care about. Product reviews by customers on a leading e-commerce site should provide a good view.
